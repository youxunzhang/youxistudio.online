### Recommendations

3. **Ad units**: Add actual ad unit code snippets to the content areas of the pages.
4. **Performance monitoring**: Keep an eye on load times and ad performance.

## 📱 Mobile Compatibility
The Google AdSense script supports:
- ✅ Desktop browsers

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Common issues
1. **Script failed to load**
   - Confirm the network connection.
   - Make sure the domain has been approved by AdSense.
   - Verify that the publisher ID is correct.

2. **Ads not displaying**
   - Allow time for the AdSense review to complete.
   - Ensure the page content complies with AdSense policies.
   - Confirm that ad unit code snippets have been added.

3. **Page performance issues**
   - The script already uses the `async` attribute so it should not block rendering.
   - Consider adding ad units near the bottom of the page.

## 📈 Next Steps
1. **Add ad units**: Embed actual ad code within the page content where appropriate.
2. **Optimize content**: Keep the content compliant with AdSense requirements.
3. **User experience**: Position ads carefully so they do not interrupt gameplay or navigation.
4. **Data analysis**: Use Google Analytics and AdSense reports to monitor results.

- Wait for Google AdSense approval.
